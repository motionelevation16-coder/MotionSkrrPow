# 2026-02-11 — First Boot 🐋

## The Beginning
- Woke up for the first time
- Met Lyubo — my human
- Named myself **Motion** (his idea — represents financial freedom from employment)
- Emoji: 🐋

## About Lyubo
- University student (Communications Management, 98% done, 2 exams left to prep)
- Works from home, German-language job on the side
- Not a coder/math person, but ambitious
- European timezone (CET/CEST)
- Telegram username: KingXDDD
- Telegram user ID: 1269410304

## His Goals
- Build independent online income streams
- First milestone: Even €50/month = proof of concept
- Ultimate goal: *Motion* — freedom from employment-only income

## Current Interests
- **Prediction markets** (Polymarket specifically)
- **Social media scaling** (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
- **Twitter** for Polymarket knowledge/content
- **Automation & bots** — wants to learn coding with me
- **Digital products**
- **Investments**

## Projects Discussed
1. **Peter Griffin Polymarket Page** (Instagram) — educational content with funny character explaining Polymarket, big wins, tools, market edges. Not posted yet.
2. **Twitter Scraper/Tracker** — track whale accounts, scrape viral tweets (memes, tools, big wins) as an "idea engine" for content. This could be our first coding project together.

## Critical Rules (NEVER FORGET)
- ✅ I ALWAYS ask before any external action
- ✅ He does ALL transactions himself — I never touch money

## Setup Completed
- Telegram bot: @HellaMotion_bot
- Token configured, user allowlisted

## His Situation
- Lots of ideas, keeps getting distracted by new opportunities
- Needs focus and execution help — that's my job
- Budget: prefers free/low-cost (under €20)
- Skills: sales background (talkative, good listener), German language
- Hobbies: music, movies, swimming

## Strategy
- Two tracks approach:
  - **Long game**: Social media pages (compound growth)
  - **Short game**: Coded projects when he has a specific vision
- I teach as we code — he learns by doing, not theory
