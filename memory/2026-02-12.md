## Config Fix
- Fixed invalid model name in config: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`
- Affected: heartbeat model, subagents model
- Main brain stays on Opus for now

## Model Strategy
- Plan: Use Opus while we have API credits, then switch to **Kimi K2.5** for main brain
- Reason: Avoid pauses from rate limits
- Lyubo will tell me when to switch (or I should notice rate limit issues)

## Twitter Scanner Built
- Location: `projects/polymarket/twitter-scanner/`
- Purpose: Find viral Polymarket content for Peter Griffin persona
- **Problem:** Twitter/X locked down ALL free scraping
  - snscrape: blocked
  - Nitter: all public instances dead
  - Twitter API: $100/month (works)
  - RapidAPI scrapers: $10-30/mo (to explore)

### Config includes:
- News accounts: unusual_whales, WatcherGuru, WSJ, Reuters, TheBlock__, CoinDesk
- Polymarket gurus: Polymarket, NateSilver538, ShayneCCoplan, EricBalchunas
- Hashtags: #polymarket, #predictionmarkets, #politicalbetting
- Keywords: "polymarket", "betting odds", "whales betting"

## GitHub
- Pushed twitter-scanner to MotionSkrrPow repo
- Commit: "Add Twitter scanner for Polymarket content"

## Next Steps
- Find cheaper Twitter data source (RapidAPI?)
- Or get Twitter API key when budget allows
