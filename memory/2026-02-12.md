## Config Fix
- Fixed invalid model name in config: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`
- Affected: heartbeat model, subagents model
- Main brain stays on Opus for now

## Model Strategy
- Plan: Use Opus while we have API credits, then switch to **Kimi K2.5** for main brain
- Reason: Avoid pauses from rate limits
- Lyubo will tell me when to switch (or I should notice rate limit issues)

## Twitter Scanner Built
- Location: `projects/polymarket/twitter-scanner/`
- Purpose: Find viral Polymarket content for Peter Griffin persona
- **Problem:** Twitter/X locked down ALL free scraping
  - snscrape: blocked
  - Nitter: all public instances dead
  - Twitter API: $100/month (works)
  - RapidAPI scrapers: $10-30/mo (to explore)

## Polymarket Content Engine Built ✅
- Location: `projects/polymarket/content-engine/`
- **polymarket_scanner.py** - Finds hot markets, detects meme-worthy bets
- **reddit_scanner.py** - Viral Reddit posts (blocked by Reddit IPs currently)
- **daily_scan.py** - Combined daily briefing with script prompts
- Output: `output/TODAY.md` with ready-to-use content ideas

### Scanner Priorities:
- 💎 High liquidity (real money)
- 😂 Meme-worthy keywords (GTA, celebrity, absurd bets)
- 🤡 Absurd patterns ("before GTA VI", "before 2030")
- ⚔️ Controversial 50/50 odds

## Peter Griffin Course Downloaded
- Location: `projects/polymarket/course/Peter Griffin Full Course/`
- Key formula: **Hook → Conflict → Payoff**
- Characters: Peter (explainer), Stewie (zoomer), Joe (insider)
- Script prompts extracted to `prompts.txt`

## First Script Written
- Topic: "Will Jesus Christ return before GTA VI?" ($9.3M volume, 47.5% YES)
- Style: Educational, explains WHY prediction markets work
- Loop structure: ending connects back to beginning for replay
- Characters: Joe (hook), Peter (explainer), Stewie (skeptic)

## Account Plans
- Handle: `@predictions.peter` (IG, TikTok, YouTube Shorts)
- Voice: ElevenLabs with Peter/Stewie clones from course
- CTA: "Follow for prediction market insights"

## Lyubo's Workflow
- 1 hour/day minimum, not mornings
- €20/month budget max
- Main time killers: overthinking + context-switching
- Goal: Learn skills (editing, vibe coding, social media) while building

## Tomorrow's Research
- Bot marketplace ideas (what do AI agents need?)
- More automation opportunities
- Improve content engine

## GitHub
- Repo: motionelevation16-coder/MotionSkrrPow
- Pushed: Twitter scanner, Polymarket content engine, course materials (PDFs only)
