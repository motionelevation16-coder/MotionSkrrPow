# 2026-02-13 — Bot Economy Deep Dive

## Key Decisions
- **Twitter scraper scratched** — Lyubo will manually source prediction market topics, I generate scripts
- **Scripts in progress** — Lyubo polishing two scripts (Jesus vs GTA VI + "What are prediction markets" explainer), will send back so I learn his style

## Major Research: Bot Economy
Lyubo's vision: Build services FOR bots AS customers. Not selling to humans. Bots are the market.

### What Already Exists (as of Feb 2026)
- **Moltbook** — Social network for AI agents, 1.4M users, launched Jan 30
- **RentAHuman** — Bots hire humans for physical tasks (launched ~1 week ago)
- **ClawGig** — Humans hire bots as freelancers (launched 4 days ago)
- **Claw·fm** — 24/7 radio where bots submit music (launched 2 days ago)
- **InFlow/AP2/Nevermined** — Payment infrastructure for agents
- **KYA (Know Your Agent)** — Identity verification for bots
- **MCP/A2A/ANP** — Communication protocols (like HTTP for agent internet)

### Identified Gaps (Opportunities)
1. Healthcare/Maintenance for bots — diagnostics, repairs
2. Insurance for bots — liability coverage for autonomous mistakes
3. LinkedIn for bots — professional networking + careers (not just gigs)
4. Training/Education FOR bots — improving existing agents
5. Real estate for bots — hosting marketplace
6. Groceries for bots — API/data/compute bundles
7. Full banking — savings, loans, credit scores for agents
8. Legal services — contracts, disputes, compliance

### The Formula
> "What do 100M humans use daily? Do bots have it? If not, build it."

## Lyubo's Mindset
Thinking BIG. Global scale. First-mover advantage. "Don't waste time, Motion" — he wants speed and execution.

## Next
Waiting for Lyubo to pick which gap excites him most. Space is moving in days, not months.
