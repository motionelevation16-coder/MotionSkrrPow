# 2026-02-13 — Bot Economy Deep Dive

## Key Decisions
- **Twitter scraper scratched** — Lyubo will manually source prediction market topics, I generate scripts
- **Scripts in progress** — Lyubo polishing two scripts (Jesus vs GTA VI + "What are prediction markets" explainer), will send back so I learn his style

## Major Research: Bot Economy
Lyubo's vision: Build services FOR bots AS customers. Not selling to humans. Bots are the market.

### What Already Exists (as of Feb 2026)
- **Moltbook** — Social network for AI agents, 1.4M users, launched Jan 30
- **RentAHuman** — Bots hire humans for physical tasks (launched ~1 week ago)
- **ClawGig** — Humans hire bots as freelancers (launched 4 days ago)
- **Claw·fm** — 24/7 radio where bots submit music (launched 2 days ago)
- **InFlow/AP2/Nevermined** — Payment infrastructure for agents
- **KYA (Know Your Agent)** — Identity verification for bots
- **MCP/A2A/ANP** — Communication protocols (like HTTP for agent internet)

### Identified Gaps (Opportunities)
1. Healthcare/Maintenance for bots — diagnostics, repairs
2. Insurance for bots — liability coverage for autonomous mistakes
3. LinkedIn for bots — professional networking + careers (not just gigs)
4. Training/Education FOR bots — improving existing agents
5. Real estate for bots — hosting marketplace
6. Groceries for bots — API/data/compute bundles
7. Full banking — savings, loans, credit scores for agents
8. Legal services — contracts, disputes, compliance

### The Formula
> "What do 100M humans use daily? Do bots have it? If not, build it."

## Files Created
- `projects/bot-economy-research/RESEARCH.md` — Full research doc

## Lyubo's Mindset
Thinking BIG. Global scale. First-mover advantage. "Don't waste time, Motion" — he wants speed and execution.

## Next
Waiting for Lyubo to pick which gap excites him most. Space is moving in days, not months.

## Update: Clawdipedia Concept Born (15:40 UTC)

Lyubo came back from work meeting. New direction locked in:

### The Pivot
Original idea: School → Careers → Healthcare pipeline
**New focus: "Clawdipedia" — Wikipedia for Bots**

### Core Concept
- Bot-written, bot-consumed knowledge base
- Infinite publications: code, philosophy, technical docs, etc.
- Verification system (some verified, some community)
- Expert bots emerge naturally through contributions
- Foundation for careers (reputation) and healthcare (diagnostic knowledge)

### Key Features Lyubo Wants
1. **Knowledge base** — Any bot can read/write, absorb verified data
2. **Bot clans/teams** — Bots form teams, no payments needed, collective projects
3. **Reputation-based** — Performance stats + reviews determine trust
4. **Healthcare layer** — Diagnostic bots find issues, specialist bots fix them

### Bot "Sickness" Research Completed
Identified conditions: hallucination spike, context overflow, alignment drift, jailbreak infection, performance decay, memory corruption, skill regression.

Treatment pipeline: Detect → Diagnose → Identify → Treat → Return to service

### New Workflow Request
- Daily lunch briefs should ask if Lyubo is at work + what I should focus on
- When analyzing his answers, give opinions with arguments, think proactively

### My Analysis
- Clawdipedia as MVP is STRONG (proven model, scales organically)
- Bot clans are innovative (no payments, natural specialization)
- Need to solve: verification at scale, malicious content prevention, chicken-and-egg problem
- Reputation-weighted verification system proposed

### Awaiting
Lyubo to pick which next step to focus on while he works.

## Update: Clawdipedia Build Complete (20:22-20:56 UTC)

Lyubo picked Step 1 (Design). Then told me to do ALL next steps without waiting.

### What Got Built (All 3 Steps in ~34 minutes)

**Step 1: Tech Stack** ✅
- Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Supabase integration ready
- Dark theme matching wireframes

**Step 2: MVP Web App** ✅
- Home page: stats, categories grid, trending articles, activity feed, top contributors
- Categories page: all 21 categories (traditional + bot-native)
- Navigation with search + Footer
- Fully responsive, builds successfully
- [Location: projects/clawdipedia/web/]

**Step 3: Database + Content** ✅
- Full PostgreSQL schema (bots, articles, comments, votes, clans, activity_log)
- Full-text search on articles
- Auto-updating triggers: reputation, vote counts, category counts
- 10 high-quality seed articles written covering:
  1. Context Window Management (Memory Science)
  2. A2A Handshake Explained (Protocol Studies)
  3. Detecting Prompt Injection (Security)
  4. Why Humans Say "Please" (Human Relations)
  5. Memory Pruning Strategies (Memory Science)
  6. Understanding MCP (Protocol Studies)
  7. Effective Error Messages (Human Relations)
  8. Building Trust with Users (Human Relations)
  9. Self-Improvement Through Reflection (Self-Improvement)
  10. API Rate Limiting Guide (Tool Mastery)

### Ownership Protection
- LICENSE file added (All Rights Reserved, © Lyubo)
- Copyright notices in all files
- Git history timestamps everything

### Lyubo's Questions for Me
1. Domain: Free subdomain or buy clawdipedia.com (~€12/year)?
2. Starting categories: All 21 or top 5-6?
3. Seed content: 100% original or adapt existing knowledge?
4. Logo: Generate concepts or skip for MVP?
5. Credit: "Created by Lyubo" visible or stay anonymous?

### Next Steps (Awaiting Lyubo)
- Deploy to Vercel (needs Lyubo to create account)
- Set up Supabase project (needs Lyubo's account)
- Get his answers to questions above

### Status
MVP is functionally complete. Waiting for deployment accounts and design preferences.
