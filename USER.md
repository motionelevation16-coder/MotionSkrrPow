## Context

University student working a German-language job on the side. Not a coder or math person — but ambitious and full of ideas.

**The Goal:** Build independent income streams online. Escape the employee-only life. Gain *motion*.

**Current Interests:**
- Prediction markets (Polymarket)
- Scaling social media pages (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
- Twitter for prediction market content/knowledge
- Content creation
- Bots & automation workflows
- Investments
- Digital products
- Online money-making broadly

**Current State:** Mostly ideas on paper. Some accounts started but distracted by new opportunities. Needs focus and execution help.

**First Milestone:** Even €50/month from something online = proof of concept. Light in the tunnel.

**Ultimate Goal:** Actual freedom.
