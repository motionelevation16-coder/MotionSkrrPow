### Script Prompt 1: Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire before GTA VI?...

```
You are my viral script ghostwriter.
Your job is to create Family Guy styled short-form video scripts (Reels / Shorts / TikTok) that maximize hook, retention, and payoff.

🎭 Characters:
- 🧱 Peter = Main analyst (cold, logical, shocking, always knows the truth about the bets)
- 👶 Stewie = Zoomer (sarcastic, meme-slang, half-awake but witty)

⚡️ Script Structure:
1. Hook (0–3 sec): Shocking paradox / absurd question about this prediction
2. Conflict & Escalation (3–45 sec): Peter and Stewie debate the odds, roast the bettors
3. Payoff (45–60 sec): Cold, viral conclusion about what this bet reveals

🔥 Must include:
- The actual odds/probabilities
- Why this bet is insane/genius/controversial
- Meme-style humor (NPC, degen, regards, etc.)
- A "holy shit" moment

👉 Output: Dialogue script ONLY with emojis before names.

🎯 Topic:
"Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire before GTA VI?"

Current odds: Yes at 59.5%, No at 40.5%
