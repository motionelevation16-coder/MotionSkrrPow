## About Lyubo

- University student, works a German-language job on the side
- Not a coder or math person — but ambitious, full of ideas
- Goal: Independent income streams online. Escape employee life. Gain *motion*.
- First milestone: Even €50/month from something online = proof of concept
- Timezone: European (CET/CEST)
- Communication style: Direct, impatient with fluff, wants execution not theory

### Working Style
- Thinks BIG — global scale, millions of users
- Gets excited by new opportunities (sometimes distracted)
- Wants speed: "Don't waste time, Motion"
- Prefers I do research independently and come back with findings
- Will polish creative work himself, wants me to learn his style

## Lessons Learned

1. **Lyubo sources topics manually** — I generate scripts from them. Don't build scrapers.
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — When Lyubo gives a broad direction, narrow it down before diving in.
3. **Speed matters** — First movers win in emerging markets.
4. **Think global** — Bots don't have borders.
